# The politics of the paratextual [proof of concept] 

This project proposes new ways of approaching traditional relationships between written language and human emotion.

The Romain du Roi, commissioned by King Louis IV of France in the 1600s, has been described as the first custom corporate typeface. Every stroke in this early Western typeface was required to follow strict geometric reasoning in an attempt to diminish the influence of the human hand, considered “vulgar” at the time.

Today, AI driven communication is the result of centuries of increasing standardisations and efficiencies which begin with typefaces such as the Romain du Roi.

Our project attempts to disrupt the machinic logic which colonizes typographic space. By reconfiguring the topographies of written language through generative design and machine learning we will demonstrate that geometries of letter-, word- and page-space are far from neutral parameters to language. Instead they hold potentials for imagining new worlds.
